# payday2.pw Mods

**This repository contains the source code of all mods currently released on [payday2.pw](https://payday2.pw).**
*The GitHub repository is always updated. The website might be a bit outdated, as I can't upload everything at once. Thanks Google Safe Browsing. As of 16th April 2022 the website is fully up-to-date though.*

[PAYDAY 2 SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz/) is required for these mods to work.

All mods contain the code in .lua-Files and the mod.txt is used for PAYDAY 2 to detect the mod and to give more information about the mods and their coders.
You can download these files either by...
* clicking on the "Raw"-Button and then saving the file via the right-click context menu.
* creating the files yourself on your computer and copying the file contents from here.

Many of these mods are **very** simple and I urge you to try modding yourself. All you need is a text editor and the LuaJIT-Source of PAYDAY 2. Contact me, if you need it - but searching on Google should do the job.

For more information, visit [payday2.pw](https://payday2.pw).
