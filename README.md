# payday2.pw Mods
**This repository contains the source code of all mods currently released on [payday2.pw](https://payday2.pw).**
[PAYDAY 2 BLT](https://github.com/JamesWilko/Payday-2-BLT/releases) is required for these mods to work.
All mods contain the code in .lua-Files and the mod.txt is used for PAYDAY 2 to detect the mod and to give more information about the mods and their coders.

Many of these mods are **very** simple and I urge you to try modding yourself. All you need is a text editor and the [PAYDAY 2 LuaJIT-Source](https://bitbucket.org/TdlQ/payday-2-luajit/src/a5da4138b230739a0b036e183aa8733fce142fd0?at=default)  dumped by TdlQ.
